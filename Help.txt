Title   : Finite State Machine(FSM) Simulator!
Author  : Shiva Prasad K
Desc    : Using this program the user can make Simple FSM which accept the letters 'a' or 'b',
          and perform respective actions.

Long Description:
    In theory of computation, a branch of theoretical computer science, a deterministic
    finite automaton (DFA), also known as deterministic finite state machine, is a finite state machine
    that accepts/rejects finite strings of symbols and only produces a unique computation (or run)
    of the automaton for each input string.

    This program was made to allow the student to create and simulate their own FSM.

======================================================================================
Instructions:

             In order to simulate an FSM,
               >> You have to first create a sketch of the FSM on paper,
              Now using the program,
               >> Create required number of states 1 by 1,
               >> Configure each of the states.
               >> Run FSM by providing the input string of 'a's and 'b's in any order.

               How to Configure a state?
           Ans: From the menu, choose configure. Select the state.
               Answer each question with either 0 or 1.

               Note: You should only have 1 active state in an FSM,
               This program was made to solve deterministic FSM only!.

======================================================================================

A Simple Example of Finite State Machine:

>>  An FSM to accept input strings with a's & b's having only Odd number of a's.

    For an FSM that accepts input strings with a's & b's having only Odd number of a's,
    we will need 2 states. Let's say that the 2 states are q0 and q1.

    q0 will be the initial state.
    q1 will be the final state.

    q0 upon 'a' gives q1
    q0 upon 'b' gives q0
    q1 upon 'a' gives q0
    q1 upon 'b' gives q1

    So, on creating such states in our FSM Simulator, we get the following result.
